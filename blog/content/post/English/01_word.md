If you're going through hell, keep going.

如果你正在经历炼狱，那就继续吧



Procrastination is the thief of time.
拖延症是时间的窃贼。



Dreams don't work unless you do.

You need to exert effort in order to achieve the results you want. You can’t just wait around for things to happen.

Once you get things done, you’ll realize you are getting closer to your goals





-  Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The sun's rays do not burn until brought to a focus.

​      将你所有的思想集中在手头的工作上。 太阳光线在聚焦之前不会燃烧。
